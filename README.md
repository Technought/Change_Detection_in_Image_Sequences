# Change Detection in Image Sequences

Object level change detection is the process of finding the change in objects in a given image sequence with respect to the reference images. In this paper, we have proposed a difference-based algorithm which can be used to classify the changes in the two different videos by converting them to each different set of image frames. Our main objective is to find diffrence between two video sequences of the same path but taken at diffrent time. 

This algorithm is mainly focuses on detecting the changes in the image sequence of a video that are captured by a drone. We capture two different sets of videos (assuming that the drone travels in same path) of which one is the reference video and the other video is the one in which the changes has to be determined. The proposed method uses the YOLO model for the object detection, a simple centroid tracker for object tracking. The output of the system is a video with bounding boxes drawn around new and missing objects.
